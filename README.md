## Purpose: To create a website that provides the experience of users with accessibility issues

## Plan
To get an MVP out by Global Accessibility Awareness Day, 20 May 2021 

### Version 1
1. Explain what a screen reader is and how to use it
2. Basic screen reader challenge
3. All 6 alt text challenges
3.1 Informative Images
3.2 Decorative Images
3.3 Functional Images
3.4 Images of Text
3.5 Complex Images
3.6 Groups of Images


### Version 2
1. Things in the wrong order
2. Unreachable input
3. Unidenitifed links
4. Tables

### Know Problems
1. Redirection  -  without `document.write("");` in read_text.html, the redirection doesn't work, why?
2. Resizing - I want the text and images to be inthe white boxes but they seep out when the page is enlarged/shrunk
3. Submit and Next should look the same (and should they be in the same position)
