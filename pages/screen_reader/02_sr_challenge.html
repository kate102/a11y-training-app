            <p>Jonathan Jo is one of my favorite poems by A. A. Milne </p>
            <p>The first verse is visable but none of the others are.</p>

                Jonathan Jo<br />
                Has a mouth like an 'O'<br />  
                And a wheelbarrow full of surprises<br />
                If you ask for a bat,<br />     
                or something like that,<br />
                He has got it, whatever the size is.

                It's no trouble at all;<br />
                Why, the more that you ask for, the merrier -<br />
                Like a hoop and a top,<br />
                And a watch that won't stop,<br />
                And some sweets, and an Aberdeen terrier.</p>

                If you give him a smile,<br />
                Only once in a while,<br />
                Then he never expects any money!</p>
