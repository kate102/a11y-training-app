            <h1>Screen Reader Challenge 1</h1>
            <h2>Lets start with an easy one...</h2>
            <p>Jonathan Jo is one of my favorite poems by A. A. Milne <br />
                In this challenge you need to answer a simple question.
            </p>
            <p>The first verse is visable but none of the others are. <br />
            So you will need to use the screen reader in order to find out the answer.</p>

            <p>Jonathan Jo<br />
            Has a mouth like an 'O'<br />  
            And a wheelbarrow full of surprises<br />
            If you ask for a bat,<br />     
            or something like that,<br />
            He has got it, whatever the size is.</p>

            <div class="hidden-text">
                <!-- If you are reading this you are cheating and might as well go and do something else with your time -->
                <p>If you're wanting a ball,<br />
                It's no trouble at all;<br />
                Why, the more that you ask for, the merrier -<br />
                Like a hoop and a top,<br />
                And a watch that won't stop,<br />
                And some sweets, and an Aberdeen terrier.</p>
                
                <p>Jonathan Jo<br />
                Has a mouth like an "O,"<br />
                But this is what makes him so funny:<br />
                If you give him a smile,<br />
                Only once in a while,<br />
                Then he never expects any money!</p>
            </div>
