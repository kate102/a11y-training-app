        <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
        <p>Accessibility, in this context, is about the user experience of using your site 
            with the assistive technology tools that they need.</p>
            <div class="fade-in-10s">
                <!-- <p>The site has been created to expose you to accessibility tools and how they work.</p> -->
                <!-- <p>Assistive technology users will simply leave the site if the hurdles become too arduos.</p> -->

            <p>Fact 1. Assistive technology users will simply leave the site if the hurdles become too arduos.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="fade-in-10s">
            <p>Fact 2. Assistive technology only fails when the underlying code isn't written properly.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="fade-in-20s">

            <p>Fact 3. Implementing accessibility enablement is straight forward if you do it from the beginning.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="fade-in-30s">
            <p>Fact 4. Many developers don't realise the implications of the coding decisions that they take when it comes to assistive technology.</p>

        <!-- <h2>This site is not fully accessible
            your challange is to complete the tasks 
            and get to the end of the of the site.</h2>
