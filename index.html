            <h2>Facts</h2>
            <p>Assistive technology users will simply leave the site if the hurdles become too arduos.</p>
            <p>Assistive technology only fails when the underlying code isn't written properly.</p>
            <p>Implementing accessibility enablement is straight forward if you do it from the beginning.</p>
            <p>Many developers don't realise the implications of the coding decisions that they take when it comes to assistive technology.</p>

            <h2>The Challenge</h2>
            <p>This site is made up of a series of pages, to get to each page you have to have completed the previous challenge.<br/>
                The challenges are initially about using aassistive technology to answer simple questions. <br />
                As you go through the site the challenges become more compelx as the underlying HTML5 is used incorrectly.
            </p>
            <p>At any point you can give up on the site, that will be the point at which we lose users on our site.</p>
